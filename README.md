# Scanned Document Tilt Correction

## Product overview

Scanned documents sometimes can have pages with wrong alignment. This can create challenges while processing of documents viz. OCR, ICR, Text extraction, image-based ML/AI modelling, etc.  
This solution incorporates statistical models which identify angle of tilt based on textual orientation, position of text relative to page boundaries and text clusters and corrects the alignment / tilt of the pages. This enables OCR / ICR engines to achieve higher accuracy and improves the subsequent text extraction pipelines.

## Product Highlight 

* This solution can be used to correct alignment issues which occur while scanning a document with scanner or phone.

* To correct the alignment / tilt of the pages, this solution performs Affine transformation and runs statistical models to identify angle of tilt. It identifies and segregates different objects while considering textual information primarily for angle calculation.

* Mphasis DeepInsights is a cloud-based cognitive computing platform that offers data extraction & predictive analytics capabilities. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
